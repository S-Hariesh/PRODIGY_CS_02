Simple Image Pixel Manipulation

**Description**

This Python program demonstrates basic image manipulation techniques using the Pillow library. It allows you to perform a simple encryption and decryption process on images by swapping red and blue pixel channels.

**Prerequisites**:

Install the Pillow library: pip install Pillow

**Understanding the Code**

  1.The script utilizes the Pillow library to load, manipulate, and save images.
  
  2.The encrypt_image function opens the input image, iterates through each pixel, swaps the red and blue channel values, and saves the modified image as the encrypted version.
  
  3.The decrypt_image function performs the reverse operation, swapping the channels back to their original positions, effectively decrypting the image.
